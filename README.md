This a readme.md file in which I am using for describing my tkinter project in python.

Initially I initializes the repository on a github.com 

I used these set of commands for pushing the local repo on the github.com.  
 <br>
1.git init<br>
2.pwd<br>
3.git status<br>
4.git add .<br>
5.git status<br>
6.git commit -m "commit messege!"<br>
.
.
.
<br>
so on..

Now,

I have created a new file name as Miles_to_Kilometer_converter.py file in which a program has a function defined and calculate the miles to kilometer converter which is the final project of Day27 of Python.
